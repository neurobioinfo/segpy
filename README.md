## Segregation Analysis
Segregation is a process to explore the genetic variant in a sample of seguence data. This pipeline counts the number of affecteds and nonaffecteds with variant, with homozygous variant, with no variant, and with no call. It gets those counts both in-family and globally. Also we also get the breakdown of not just variants, but also the breakdown of alleles in each. To achive the segregation, one needs a pedigree file with six columns: `familyid`, `individualid`, `parentalid`, `maternalid`, `sex`{1:male; 2:female, 0:unknown}, and `phenotype`={1: control (unaffected), 2: proband(affected), -9:missing}. And the genetic data must be in the `vcf` format.

## seganalyis
`seganalyis` is a python module developed to run segregation, 

## segrun.svn
`segrun.svn` is a pipeline (shield) developed to run step 1 to step 3 under HPC system, the pipeline has been using under [Beluga](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga), the detail of how to use it is discussed in [segrun.svn](https://github.com/neurobioinfo/scrnabox/tree/main/scrnabox.svn)
