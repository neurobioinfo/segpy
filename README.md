## Segregation Analysis
Segregation is a process to explore the genetic variant in a sample of seguence data. This pipeline counts the number of affecteds and nonaffecteds with variant, with homozygous variant, with no variant, and with no call. It gets those counts both in-family and globally. Also we also get the breakdown of not just variants, but also the breakdown of alleles in each. To achive the segregation, one needs a pedigree file with six columns: `familyid`, `individualid`, `parentalid`, `maternalid`, `sex`{1:male; 2:female, 0:unknown}, and `phenotype`={1: control (unaffected), 2: proband(affected), -9:missing}. And the genetic data must be in the `vcf` format.

## How to run
The segregation can do done using the  `seganalyis` module in python, if you have access to HPC, you can automate it using segrun.svn. 

### seganalyis
`seganalyis` is a python module developed to run segregation,

### segrun.svn
`segrun.svn` is a pipeline (shield) developed to run step 1 to step 3 under HPC system, the pipeline has been using under [Beluga](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/B%C3%A9luga),  the detail of using it is discussed in [segrun.svn](https://github.com/neurobioinfo/segregation/tree/main/segrun.svn)
